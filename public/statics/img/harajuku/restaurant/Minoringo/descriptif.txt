This place is rated No.1 in the “curry” category in the Harajuku area and it was also featured on TV so we decided to come try it. 
It’s a hole in the wall kind of restaurant and the owner must be a fan of the comic “One Piece” since they have figurines from it 
scattered throughout the entire restaurant. As for the food, Minoringo has four types of curry: Chicken (Mild), Pork (Semi-Spicy),
 Keema (Spicy), and Beef (Very Spicy) and they are available in three different sizes (S-800yen, M-900yen, and L-1000yen). 
You can also order the Minoringo special that includes both the Keema and the Chicken curry on the same plate for 400yen more.

I ordered the medium-sized Keema Curry that comes with an egg on the top and I added melted cheese for an extra 150yen. 
The curry was well-seasoned and the melted cheese was really good but overall it was a bit spicy for me. I’m not too hard core with 
spicy food so that must be why. If you’re into spicy food, you will probably love this as many other people do. 
The other dish pictured above is the medium-sized Minoringo Special. The mixture of the spicy keema curry with 
the mild chicken curry in the Special dish seemed to be the perfect combo because the spices were very well balanced and it lets you appreciate the food more.
The chicken curry is made with tomato and yogurt as well so it has more of a mild sweet flavor to it. I found myself wishing 
I had ordered the special after trying a bite of it… sigh

Just a note, the Beef and Pork are very popular and the owner said it usually sells out by 3 or 4pm so come here for lunch if you’d like to try one of those two.
