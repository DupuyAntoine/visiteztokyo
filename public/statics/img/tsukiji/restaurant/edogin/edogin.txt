Edo-style sushi with a history of 80 years, loved from long ago even by foreigners, too. We serve fresh fish and shellfish.
Founder Ginzo Kondo reflected upon the importance of eating delicious fresh fish to one's heart's content, as it wasn't common at that time to eat fresh fish before the Showa period. Then he then came up with hand-shaped sushi and opened EDOGIN. EDOGIN sushi, made with large pieces of fish and small amounts of rice is the starting point of Edo-style sushi. The fact that its spirit is still alive today shows it is still loved by customers all over the world.
