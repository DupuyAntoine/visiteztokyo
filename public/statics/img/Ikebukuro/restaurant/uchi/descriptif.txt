Uchi is one of those hidden ramen shops far and away from the major streets that you would never stumble upon unless somebody recommends
 it to you and give you a guide specifically to look out for it.  When we first had the mixture of pork bone and seafood based ramen from Uchi,
 we were stunned how such a small shop in a hidden street in Ikebukuro could serve such outstanding bowl. 
The great chewy texture of the noodles inside the thick flavored soup, which makes the locals addicted to it sometimes,
 with a slice of delicious chashu pork set aside with the fresh bamboo shoots is simply phenomenal. Among many tempting choices on the menu,
 the Tokusei Soba ???? (980 Yen) is just exceptionally good.
