- Hinochiko park :

A vast greenbelt, emerging at the heart of Roppongi.
Vast open space, giving those who live and work here precious moments of tranquility and peace of mind.
An immense natural setting, spanning some 40% of the total grounds. The source of human healing and energy, to regenerate the creative juices.

Stepping into this realm places visitors in a natural art gallery, where trees literally compete with each other for beauty.
Some 140 cherry, camphor and other tree genres that remained at the site of the former Self Defense Agency have been transplanted here, and now foster some of the richest greenery seen in central Tokyo. Wireless LAN access points are installed in the green belt area as well, for access to full-fledged information communications even in the midst of the lush green environment.

A municipal park, Hinokicho Park belonging to Minato Ward, lies in the east side of Tokyo Midtown. This site was formerly the garden attached to the Azabu villa residence for the Mori Family, a member of the Hagi Clan during the Edo Period (1603~1868). This residence was also known as the “Hinoki Mansion” linked to the large number of hinoki (cypress) trees on the grounds. This impressive greenery was known as “Shimizu Garden,” and enjoyed fame for its sweeping view of Edo (old Tokyo). The flora of this storied garden has now remerged as a park. There has been no change at all, however, in the rich “Japanese beauty” exuded here.
